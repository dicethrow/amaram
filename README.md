# Amaram

This is a python library, providing RAM peripheral interfaces for amaranth language HDL projects.

Currently, only a n-async-FIFO interface for SDRAM is implemented, and it has only been tested on a ULX3S board.

# todo
- add quality documentation, and perhaps a video of how it works
- add tests that run on the ULX3S board, and on a second board demonstrating that it can be cross-platform
- add a demo use app, perhaps implementing the backend of a logic analyser using the LUNA interfaces
