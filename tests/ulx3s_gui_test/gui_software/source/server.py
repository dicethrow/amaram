# server_cp.py Server for IOT communications.

# Released under the MIT licence.
# Copyright (C) Peter Hinch 2019-2020

# Maintains bidirectional full-duplex links between server applications and
# multiple WiFi connected clients. Each application instance connects to its
# designated client. Connections are resilient and recover from outages of WiFi
# and of the connected endpoint.
# This server and the server applications are assumed to reside on a device
# with a wired interface on the local network.

# Now uses and requires uasyncio V3. This is incorporated in daily builds
# and release builds later than V1.12
# Under CPython requires CPython 3.8 or later.
